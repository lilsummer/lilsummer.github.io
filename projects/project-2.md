Price elasticity is a key economic concept widely used to measure the change of customersâ€™ demand in response to price changes. In this study I used real world customer data to approximate the real demand, and estimated price elasticity from regression models. Several data transformation methods were compared. The robustness and feasibility of the selected price elasticity model prototypes were evaluated. We concluded that using a specific transformation model to estimate price elasticity shows promising results and can be applied for other key economical models.
